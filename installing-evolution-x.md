# Installing Evolution X
This guide will help you with installing our ROM. Keep in mind, that this is a very basic description of the flashing procedure and you should always check device specific exceptions in your device's [XDA](https://xda-developers.com) thread.

*Before we begin, we assume that you have a custom recovery project installed on your device.*

## Downloading the ROM
To get started, you will need to download the ROM for your device. It is important to download the correct build for your device.
> *Do not flash builds for other devices, as it will brick your device!*

You can download the ROM zip from the [official site](https://evolution-x.org/devices). You will need to know your device model or codename to find the correct build. If you cannot find a build for your device, it is likely that your phone is not officially supported. You may be able to find unofficial builds, but we don't offer support for those.

## Selecting the correct vendor
Check the XDA thread of your device to find the required vendor or firmware for the ROM and download it.

> *Do not flash GApps, we include them by default in the ROM*

## Flashing the ROM
After having downloaded the correct ROM build and vendor/firmware zip file, we can proceed with the flashing process. Boot your device into recovery mode, and wipe data, cache and system using your custom recovery. <br>
Flash the required vendor/firmware and the downloaded ROM build. Reboot to system and enjoy the ROM.

*The first bootup could take some additional time*

## Installing magisk
Flash the magisk zip (after one reboot) and reboot to system.
