# I want Evolution X to support XY device
You want the ROM to support your favorite device, eh? That's right, who doesn't want us to build for their device. However, this is not that easy as you think.

## Blind builds
We can't build for your device if *we do not have the said device*. Blind building is not appropriate for officially maintained devices and therefore, we do not do it. In order for us to make proper builds for your device, we need to have the device. Simple as that.

## Ask a friend
If you know someone, who can build ROMs for your device, politely ask them to do so. Do *not* spam their dms or ask them repeatedly.
