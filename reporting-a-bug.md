# Reporting a bug
This page will guide you on making a proper bug report.

## Where can I report a bug?
You can submit a bug report on your device's XDA thread. Please follow the required format and do *not* report a bug that has already been submitted.

## What do I need to include in my bug report?
Firstly, you will need to write the description of the bug. Please explain the procedure of reproducing / environment of the bug. It is also required to attach screenshots or a logcat. <br>
For more info, see the [example bug report format](#example-bug-report-format)

## How can I take a logcat?
You can use ADB to record a logcat by using the command `adb logcat -d`. <br>
Alternatively you can use the [syslog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog&hl=en_US) app.

## Why do I need to keep the bug reporting rules?
It is way easier for the developer and for other users as well, to see your bug report organized and not just a complaint. This way the developer will be able to implement a solution to the bug you found and other users won't re-report the bug.

## Example bug report format
Bug description: `<write the description of the bug here>` <br>
How to reproduce: `<write the method of reproducing the bug here>` <br>
Logcat: `<upload your logcat to pastebin or hastebin and paste the link here>` <br>
Screenshots: `<you can attach screenshots to the bug report>`
